The ##### walked through the field, and another ##### followed behind.
One ##### saw a carrot, and the other ##### wanted it too.
In the distance, a third ##### brayed loudly, startling the first #####.
All three #####s gathered under the tree, where the youngest ##### took a nap.
Each ##### had a different way of braying, but all #####s were equally loud.
A ##### is stubborn, but a determined ##### can move mountains, said the old #####.
The little ##### kicked the rock, and the big ##### laughed at the sight.




------ problem num 06 ------

The **######** trotted along, unaware of the **#####** racing
 past the grand **########**.  In the distance, another **######** brayed while the **########** raised 
its trunk, trumpeting loud enough to startle the **#####**.  
The **#####** neighed nervously as the **######** looked up at the towering 
**########** beside it.  Even the **########**, with all its might, couldnâ€™t calm the curious **######** 
chasing after the swift **#####**. One day, the **#####**, **######**, and **########** will all sit together
 under the shade, sharing tales of their adventures.
