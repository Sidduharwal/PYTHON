twinkle in the Night

Beneath a sky of velvet blue,
The stars begin their nightly cue,
Their soft and gentle twinkle bright,
A scattered dance of silver light.

Each tiny star a whispered dream,
A shimmering, celestial beam,
They paint the heavens with their grace,
A twinkle in the cosmic space.

The moon, a lantern hanging high,
Watches with a knowing eye,
Its glow a tender, soft embrace,
A partner in the starlit chase.

The night is filled with tales untold,
In every twinkle, secrets bold,
They speak of worlds beyond our sight,
Of endless realms in starry light.

So when you gaze into the night,
Let the twinkle fill your sight,
For in their dance and gentle gleam,
Lie the echoes of a dream.
